# Playground-projects

This is a collection of small to medium-size projects I work on as I try to build bigger projects. It's my coding playground. If any of these projects become useful enough to be worth sharing, I will move them to their own repos.  
  
**Goals**
- build utils that will become part of bigger projects, such as:
    - EBBI $^1$
    - LHOWW $^2$
    - BRFP 
      
    
**Naming conventions**
- sub-folder names
    - \[file_type]\_\[language]\_\_\[project_name]
    - e.g.: gm_py__king_othello
- project types
    - gm: game
    - ut: util (e.g. map widget, etc.)
- languages
    - py: python
    - js: javascript

**References**  
- $^1$ **EBBI** is a project in which I try to build a Jarvis style app. I envision EBBI being my personal AI assistant.  
- $^2$ **LHOWW** stands for *Learning How the World Works*. I envision LHOWW being a webapp which makes it easy to interactively explore our world's past and present and to simulate possible futures. The webapp is phase I of the project. Phase II is building a VR game.

**Notes**
- 13aug22: decided to move the forked projects to their own folder to more accurately reflect the number of projects I build or I directly contribute to
