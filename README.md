# Playground-projects

This is a collection of small to medium-size projects I work on as I try to build bigger projects like EBBI$^1$ and LHOWW$^2$. It's my coding playground. If any of these projects become useful enough to be worth sharing, I will move them to their own repos. 

$^1$ EBBI is a project in which I try to build a Jarvis style app. I envision EBBI being my personal AI assistant.
$^2$ LHOWW stands for Learning How the World Works. My plan is to first build a webapp, then a VR game, which make it easy to interactively explore our worlds past and present and to simulate possible futures.
