# Playground-projects

This is a collection of small to medium-size projects I work on as I try to build bigger projects. It's my coding playground. If any of these projects become useful enough to be worth sharing, I will move them to their own repos.  
  
**Goals**
- build utils that will become part of bigger projects, such as:
    - EBBI $^1$
    - LHOWW $^2$
    - BRFP  
  
### Notes
---
- $^1$ **EBBI** is a project in which I try to build a Jarvis style app. I envision EBBI being my personal AI assistant.  
- $^2$ **LHOWW** stands for *Learning How the World Works*. I envision LHOWW being a webapp which makes it easy to interactively explore our worlds past and present and to simulate possible futures. The webapp is phase I of the project. Phase II is building a VR game.
