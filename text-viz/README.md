# Text-viz
  
Text-viz is a webapp that makes it easy to take text data and visualize it based on the type of data it is. For example:
- geo data is mapped
- person data is shown in a picture gallery
- time data is shown on a timeline
- text stats data (word count, word frequency, etc) is shown on charts, word clouds, etc.
  
**Notes:**
- 18aug22: jupyter notebooks are for testing ideas. Not sure it's the best workflow. Good enough for now.
