| 1  |13-aug-22|~~wikipedia-entry-map_it~~|~~webapp that calls the wikipedia API for a certain search term, shows the wikipedia page, uses NLP to identify places, and maps them (tooltips with order in which they appeared on the page, name, etc)~~ $^1$| 
| 2  |18-aug-22|text-viz                  |webapp that makes it easy to visualize various pieces of data in a text: e.g. geo data on a map, person data in a photo gallery, nlp data in charts and word clouds, etc.|
| 3  |18-aug-22|screen-ocr                |webapp or chrome extension that uses ocr to take text data on the screen (e.g. pdf, blog post, ebook in format other than pdf, image, etc) and puts it into text file $^2$|


**Notes:**
$^1$ 18aug22: a better idea is text-viz. It expands on wikipedia-entry-map-it in at least two ways:
1. it uses more sources of data, not just wikipedia pages (e.g. pdfs, images of text that can be read using OCR, etc.)
2. it has more features:
- in addition to the geo data, it visualizes data such as people, events, text stats, etc.
- it allows tagging pieces of text
$^2$ 18aug22: this is one of the features in project-idea no. 2 (text-viz), but I'm making it into a separate project because it's large enough to justify it and because it will be useful in other projects as well
